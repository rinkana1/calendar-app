# calendar-app
 I'm attempting to make a calender app from scratch using HTML, JS, and CSS


Hello I'm Rinkana1! I'm familiar with a few coding languages, but right now I'm trying to polish up some of my JS skills so I decided to make a calendar app. 
My goal by the end is to have an app that lets you go back as far as January 1st, 1970 and add and remove events to any given date from then until the present and future. 
This is just a little side project that I'm working on but hopefully I can finish it!

Here's my Todo List
-Be able to access date up until 1/1/1970 at 00:00:00
-Be able to add events to any date
-Be able to remove events from any date
-If the webpage is opened within 24 hours of an event, you'll get a reminder that the event is near
