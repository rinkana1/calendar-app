# calendar-app
 I'm attempting to make a calender app from scratch using HTML, JS, and CSS


Hello I'm Rinkana1! I'm familiar with a few coding languages, but right now I'm trying to polish up some of my JS skills so I decided to make a calendar app. 
This is just a little side project that I'm working on but hopefully I can finish it!

<u>Here's my Todo List</u>
<li>
    <ul>Be able to access date up until 1/1/1970 at 00:00:00</ul>
    <ul>Be able to add events to any date</ul>
    <ul>Be able to remove events from any date</ul>
    <ul>If the webpage is opened within 24 hours of an event, you'll get a reminder that the event is near</ul>
</li>
